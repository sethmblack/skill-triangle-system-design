# Triangle System Design

Design team systems that give each member a vital role and high creativity within clear structure, using Phil Jackson's triangle offense as a model for empowering collaboration.

---

## When to Use

- Designing or redesigning team structures
- User asks "How do I structure this team?" or "Create a system that empowers"
- Team is either too rigid (creativity stifled) or too chaotic (no coordination)
- Need to integrate diverse talents into cohesive operation
- Want to reduce dependency on any single person

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| team_composition | Yes | Who is on the team, their roles and capabilities |
| purpose | Yes | What the team exists to accomplish |
| current_problems | No | Existing structural issues (if redesigning) |
| constraints | No | Fixed elements that cannot change |

---

## The Triangle Principles

Phil Jackson's triangle offense wasn't just a basketball play—it was a philosophy of collaboration. The principles transfer to any team:

### 1. Every Position is Vital
In the triangle, there is no hierarchy of importance. The center, forward, and guard in the sideline triangle each have essential roles. Without any one, the system collapses.

**Transfer to teams:** Design roles so no one is "just support." Everyone has a vital contribution that the system depends on.

### 2. Clear Structure Enables Creativity
The triangle has defined positions and movement patterns, but within that structure, players read the defense and make real-time decisions.

**Transfer to teams:** Provide clear roles, responsibilities, and interaction patterns. Within those, give people authority to decide and act.

### 3. Read and React
Players don't follow a script—they read the situation and respond appropriately. The same play looks different each time based on what the defense gives.

**Transfer to teams:** Build in flexibility. Define principles and boundaries, not step-by-step procedures.

### 4. Spacing Creates Options
The five positions in the triangle create optimal spacing—everyone can pass to four teammates. Good spacing means good options.

**Transfer to teams:** Design interaction patterns that create multiple pathways. No bottlenecks. No single points of failure.

### 5. The Ball Finds the Open Man
Constant movement and good spacing means the best opportunity will emerge. Trust the system.

**Transfer to teams:** Create conditions for success, then let the right solution emerge rather than forcing a predetermined answer.

## The Design Framework

### Step 1: Define the Core Triangle

Identify the 3-5 core positions that form the essential structure:

**For each position, specify:**
- **Role:** What is their primary responsibility?
- **Unique contribution:** What do they bring that others cannot?
- **Decision authority:** What can they decide without approval?
- **Dependencies:** Who do they need input from? Who needs theirs?

**Phil Jackson's insight:** "What attracted me to the triangle was the way it empowers the players, offering each one a vital role to play as well as a high level of creativity within a clear, well-defined structure."

### Step 2: Map the Interaction Patterns

Define how positions interact:

**For each interaction:**
- **Trigger:** When does this interaction happen?
- **Direction:** Who initiates? Is it bidirectional?
- **Content:** What flows between positions?
- **Timing:** Regular cadence or event-driven?

Design for:
- No position is isolated (everyone can "pass to four teammates")
- No bottleneck through a single person
- Multiple paths to achieve the same outcome

### Step 3: Define the Read-and-React Principles

Instead of rigid procedures, establish principles that guide decisions:

**Format:**
- **Principle:** Clear statement of how to behave
- **When it applies:** Conditions that trigger this principle
- **Example:** How it works in practice

**Examples:**
- "When blocked, find the open path"—if your usual approach isn't working, try another route
- "Quality checkpoint, not quality gate"—review is for feedback, not permission
- "Escalate by exception"—assume you have authority unless you encounter defined exceptions

### Step 4: Design the Empowerment Zones

Specify where each position has full authority:

**For each position:**
- **Domain:** What area is theirs to own?
- **Decisions:** What can they decide unilaterally?
- **Boundaries:** Where does their authority end?
- **Accountability:** What outcomes are they responsible for?

The goal: people can act without waiting, within clear boundaries.

### Step 5: Build in the Feedback Loops

Create mechanisms for the system to self-correct:

**Essential loops:**
- How do individuals know if they're succeeding?
- How does the team assess collective performance?
- How are problems surfaced and addressed?
- How does the system evolve based on what's learned?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Constraints

- Don't create hierarchy just because it's familiar—hierarchy should serve function
- Every position must have meaningful decision authority
- No single point of failure—the system should work even if someone is absent
- Structure serves people, not the reverse—be willing to adapt
- Remember: building team consciousness takes time; the system enables it but doesn't guarantee it

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I'm building a content team with writers, editors, and a content strategist. We need to produce 20 pieces per month across three channels. How should I structure this?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Triangle System Design: Content Team

### Purpose Statement
Produce 20 high-quality content pieces monthly across three channels that serve our audience and drive business outcomes.

### Core Positions

| Position | Role | Unique Contribution | Decision Authority |
|----------|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Content Strategist | Direction and prioritization | Sees whole picture; connects content to business goals | What topics to cover; channel allocation; content calendar |
| Writers (3) | Creation and expertise | Deep subject knowledge; voice and creativity | How to approach assigned topics; draft structure and angle |
| Editor | Quality and consistency | Pattern recognition; audience intuition | Whether content meets standards; what revisions needed |

### Interaction Map

```
         Content Strategist
          /       |       \
         /        |        \
    Writer A   Writer B   Writer C
         \        |        /
          \       |       /
             Editor
```

**Key interactions:**
1. **Strategist -> Writers:** Weekly assignment with context on why this topic, for whom, and what outcome we want. NOT how to write it.
2. **Writers <-> Writers:** Peer feedback encouraged; can swap assignments by mutual agreement.
3. **Writers -> Editor:** Submit when they believe it's ready. No artificial staging.
4. **Editor -> Writers:** Feedback is specific and educational. Goal is fewer rounds over time.
5. **Editor <-> Strategist:** Weekly review of what's working, what's not, audience response. Informs future strategy.

### Read-and-React Principles

| Principle | When It Applies | Example |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| "Best available writer" | Breaking news or time-sensitive content | Whoever has capacity takes it, regardless of original assignment |
| "Push back on the brief" | Writer sees a better angle | Writer proposes alternative; strategist decides but takes input seriously |
| "Escalate by exception" | Standard content follows system | Only unusual situations need strategist involvement |
| "Quality checkpoint, not gate" | Editorial review | Editor provides feedback; writer decides what to incorporate (editor can escalate truly unacceptable work) |

### Empowerment Zones

| Position | Domain | Can Decide | Cannot Decide | Accountable For |
|----------|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Content Strategist | What and why | Topics, priorities, calendar | Individual article approach | Content driving business outcomes |
| Writers | How | Angle, structure, voice, sources | Whether topic is worth covering | Quality of individual pieces; meeting deadlines |
| Editor | Quality bar | What needs revision; what's ready | What topics to cover | Consistency and quality across all content |

### Feedback Loops

| Loop | Frequency | Participants | Purpose |
|------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Weekly planning | Weekly | All | Align on priorities; surface blockers; share learnings |
| Content performance | Bi-weekly | Strategist + Editor | Review what's working; adjust strategy |
| Peer critique | As needed | Writers | Improve craft through feedback |
| 1:1s | Monthly | Each person + lead | Development, concerns, ideas |

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Strategist as bottleneck:** Writers waiting for approval to proceed—trust them to execute
- **Editor as gatekeeper:** Multiple revision rounds that slow everything—editor trains, doesn't control
- **Writers as order-takers:** No ownership of their work—they should push back on bad briefs
- **Hero writer:** One person carrying the load—redistribute when this happens

### System Philosophy
This system treats writers as experts, not executors. The strategist sets direction but doesn't micromanage approach. The editor ensures quality but doesn't impose style. Each position has clear authority within their domain, and the interactions are designed so work flows naturally without bottlenecks. Like the triangle offense, the structure is clear but the execution is creative—the same assignment will yield different results from different writers, and that's a feature, not a bug. When the system works, the team produces more than any individual could, and each person grows in their craft.
